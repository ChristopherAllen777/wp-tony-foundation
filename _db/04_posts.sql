We addressÂ critical needs for families in crisis due to cancer diagnosis. Our goal is to focus on meeting immediate, existing needs for families whose sole income earner, in their most productive years, has been diagnosed with cancer and is unable to continue employment.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about our strategy for supporting families impacted by cancer, read <a href=\"http://tonyfoundation.wpengine.com/our-journey-begins/\">Our Journey Begins</a>.\r\n\r\n</section><section id=\"tonys-story\" class=\"about-section\">\r\n<h1>Tony\'s Story</h1>\r\nMy name is Tony Laudadio, I am 34 with a wife and 3 daughters, and I have cancer. I was first diagnosed at age 29, in July of 2013, with renal cell carcinoma and a very large tumor. It caused me to lose my right kidney and forced me out of work for several months. I thought I was well on my way to recovery and potentially ringing the bell (sort of a fun cancer free ritual they do at MD Anderson)Â when I unexpectedly had my first two seizures. On September 24, 2015, I was diagnosed with a second, completely unrelated cancer -- brain cancer.\r\n\r\nAfter my docs determined I had Oligodendroglia Grade 3 Brain cancer, I underwent a successful \"awake craniotomy,\" which is a very specialized and rare surgery. It was about 8-10 hours long and I was awake for most of it. Following that, I underwent 30 days of brain radiation and 14 months of physical therapy and chemotherapy. Currently, my cancer is stable. But the fight we are facing is far from over and it will most likely be one that I battle for a long time.\r\n\r\nI feel like I have a great attitude and I think that is an absolute must. I have kindly been told that I am inspiring and brave and some other qualities, but honestly I am just trying to be like my role models were to me growing up. My grandparents and parents, my three siblings, my aunts and uncles, cousins, my close friends are all people who showed me how to get through tough times.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_124\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"227\"]<img class=\"wp-image-124 size-medium\" src=\"http://tonyfoundation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2208-e1520394646667-227x300.jpg\" alt=\"A picture of Tony\'s wife Carrie standing at the top of a hill with a picturesque background, wearing an \'I CAN fight cancer\' t-shirt.\" width=\"227\" height=\"300\" /> Tony\'s wife Carrie hiking in Tahoe[/caption]\r\n\r\nMost important of all, my wife, Carrie, has been my absolute rock through all of this. She was 7 months pregnant when they removed a tumor the size of a butternut squash from my kidney. Two years later, she was 8 months pregnant at MD Anderson when they operated on a large tumor in my brain. Her strength is remarkable.\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows Carrie definitely knows how true this is. She has been with me every step of the way and our love is stronger now than it has ever been. Throughout all of this, she has managed to provide structure at home with our kids, and she has been my biggest inspiration every day.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have always loved competition. I treat this experience like an adverse competitive situation, which is never something I have shied away from in the past. Anybody that knows me, knows that I live for those kind of moments. At times, cancer does test my resolve and patience, but I now use such a tough life issue to show my 3 daughters, my friends, and my family how to stare down adversity and continue to tell âem to \"bring it on.â\r\n\r\nThanks for reading my story. I hope that it might inspire you, or someone else you may be close with so please share it with others. I also encourage others to reach out for help if you need it.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nTony Laudadio\r\n<p class=\"tony-quote\">\"Worry is a terrible waste of the imagination.â\r\n<span class=\"tony-quote-author\">author unknown</span></p>\r\n\r\n</section><!--#tonys-story-->', 'About', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'about', '', '', '2018-03-29 22:47:10', '2018-03-29 22:47:10', '', 0, 'http://tonyfoundation.wpengine.com/?post_type=tfcustompage&#038;p=123', 0, 'tfcustompage', '', 0),

While the shock of such news is still fresh, life and its obligations continue â sometimes with mounting medical bills and other financial stresses. This is especially critical when the person who is diagnosed with cancer happens to be the financial provider for the family, and their medical condition is serious enough that they are no longer able to work.\r\n\r\nTony Foundation is a non-profit corporation based in Austin, Texas. Our goal is to help fill a critical financial need that comes with a new cancer diagnosis. Tony Laudadioâs family faced this very predicament â first, when he was diagnosed in 2013, at age 29, with renal cell carcinoma â and again, two years later, when he was diagnosed with brain cancer (completely unrelated to the renal cancer). He and his family understand the struggle of facing a sudden battery of tests, treatments and even surgeries, while being unable to work due to cancer. Immediate expenses pile up quick, adding to an already intense level of stress and worry.\r\n\r\nThatâs why he and Scott Patterson created the Tony Foundation: to provide financial assistance to help meet immediate, existing needs for families whose sole income earners, in their most productive years, have been diagnosed with cancer and are unable to continue employment.\r\n\r\nWe will accomplish this by:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Identifying critical needs for families in crisis due to cancer diagnosis</li>\r\n 	<li>Filling a gap for cancer patients, primarily aged 25-55, who solely provide for a family/multiple dependents</li>\r\n 	<li>Providing financial assistance to qualifying families</li>\r\n 	<li>Connecting families with other programs and resources for support</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNow is the time to help make a difference for families that need it the most. Please help support us in our mission as we aim to ease some of the stress and burden facing families in crisis as they begin to navigate a new journey with cancer.

We received several messages like the following (from Facebook), which mean a lot:\r\n\r\n<em>âI think the non-profit you\'re starting is such a noble cause. My mom had cancer when I was very young â¦ thankfully she survived, but because she was the main bread winner, our family really suffered financially for many, many years after. What a great thing you\'re doing!â</em>\r\n\r\nIt really drives home the fact that cancer changes peoplesâ lives in ways we canât always see and predict. A personâs cancer battle can affect their children and other family members for years and possibly even the rest of their lives. The mission of Tony Foundation is to try to help families caught in this very situation â the sole provider/income earner is no longer able to work due to treatment or other effects of their cancer. This can be especially critical at the outset, when the family is still reeling from a new diagnosis and facing a lot of up-front medial costs.\r\n\r\nWe canât do this without you!

(266, 2, '2018-05-23 13:03:16', '2018-05-23 13:03:16', '<em>By Kevin Laudadio</em>\r\n\r\nThe word that comes to mind when I think about Tonyâs cancer surgeries is <span style=\"font-style: normal !msorm;\"><em>Family</em></span>.Â The first time we all gathered at MD Anderson was for his kidney surgery, back in 2013, and the waiting room of the hospital resembled one of our many family reunions: parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends, and our honorary family priest. We ate, talked, laughed, and prayed, maintaining an outwardly positive attitude all the while secretly terrified that the doctors would come out with some sort of unexpected news. Fortunately, that didnât happen, and before long I was hosting Tony and his then 3-year old daughter and 8-months pregnant wife at my place for several weeks during his post-op recovery.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_268\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"241\"]<img class=\"wp-image-268 size-medium\" src=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tony-Kevin-kids-sized-241x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"241\" height=\"300\" /> The young brothers: Tony (left) and Kevin[/caption]\r\n\r\nIt is a very surreal thing, dealing with a family memberâs cancer.Â  Thereâs the daily frenzy: doctorâs appointments, meals, kids, insurance. Then thereâs the sort of slow burn, the worry, the dread, the unnamed feeling in the pit of your stomach that never quite goes away.Â  FamilyÂ was the support that got me through those days, and Iâd wager that itâs also whatÂ got Tony and Carrie through them, too.Â  Helping with a precocious 3-year old, trying to only have âorganicâ food in the house, shoppingÂ for comfortable pillows for Tony so he could sort of sit up in bed; these became my daily tasks. <em>Keep the hands busy so the mind doesnât overload</em> was our unspoken mantra. And in the back of my mind was always the knowledge that it was a tremendous privilege to be able to help, to be present for such a pivotal moment in Tonyâs and his familyâs lives. And in circle-of-life fashion, about a month after all this I became an uncle again when Carrie had their second little girl!\r\n\r\nThe second round of cancer was certainly unexpected: a minor seizure at the coffee shop leading to a âletâs-rule-out-the-worst-case-scenarioâ brain scan, which revealed the worst-case scenario: a brain tumor. Again, Carrie was 8 months pregnant, this time with two little ones running around, and the feelings of worry and dread redoubled.Â Again, family was the lifeline.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_269\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-269 size-medium\" src=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waiting-room-sized-300x246.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\" /> In the waiting room at MD Anderson Cancer Center[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe crowd at the hospital for the brain surgery was even larger than two years prior.Â In true Laudadio fashion, food, laughter, and prayer got us through the almost 10-hour surgery. It was a bit surreal, sitting in the waiting room, knowing that just yards down the hall Tony was awake while doctors opened his skull and removed as much of the tumor as they safely could. When Carrie came out from visiting him after the procedure, it was a great relief to hear âhe feels goodâ! Again, roughly a month after the surgery, the family grew again when Carrie delivered a beautiful little girl. Thereâs certainly no correlation, but I figure weâre good to go in the cancer department as long as Carrie avoids being 8-months pregnant!\r\n\r\nIâll wrap up here with a statement that is familiar to everyone reading: Cancer Sucks. Renal cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer â all cancer sucks. I was so excited when Tony envisioned and then created this foundation to help families going through the same experience as ours. First, watching how dedicated and excited he is about the Tony Foundation is awesome. Heâs the most energetic Iâve seen him in years!Â  Second, but no less vital, the opportunity to affect change in even a single familyâs experience is a gift. Family is what got us through our journey so far, and the Tony Foundation envisions a way for us to provide that support to other families going through difficult and challenging times.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_270\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"245\"]<img class=\"wp-image-270 size-medium\" src=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tony-brothers-sized-245x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" /> Tony in recovery at MD Anderson after surgery for brain cancer, with brothers Cary (center) and Kevin (right)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThere are several ways you can lend your support as a valued member of our Tony Foundation family, from signing up for <a href=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/subscribe\">email updates,</a> liking ourÂ <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tonyfoundation\">Facebook page,</a> and sharing <a href=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/subscribe\">TonyFoundation.org</a> with your friends and colleagues.

It was an awesome summer party complete with a dunk tank(!), games, swimming, delicious food, music and family fun. Check out this fantastic video highlighting the event:\r\n\r\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEOAm_KAjSY[/embed]\r\n\r\n(Special thanks to Brian Dickman for another awesome video, and Missy Dickman for the excellent photos!)\r\n\r\nAfter the event, Cheyenne wrote the following letter to explain why he and Angela felt so strongly about holding a fundraiser for Tony Foundation:\r\n\r\n<em>I have known Tony for many years now and he and his family have become a big part of our lives. When we first heard of his first round of cancer we couldnât believe it, and to then hear that after he beat it he then came down with a second. Words canât express the way we felt!!!</em>\r\n\r\n<em>One thing we all know about Tony is he is probably the most positive person on the planet. Nothing is going to stop him from beating this terrible disease. Tony has managed to keep himself busy, whether it be continuing doing everything he did before to starting his foundation to help others.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>When Tony asked us to host a fundraiser at our house my answer was not yes, but \"heck\" yes! So, we immediately started planning. We wanted to have a relaxing event with all of our best friends and family. We made hamburgers, hot dogs, and had multiple sides brought in. The night before, the dunk tank was dropped off, which we had to try out (of course). Brett Curry donated multiple raffle items. James Delgado ran a 3-ball billiards tourney. Greg Rusnak ran a corn hole tourney. And of course, all the kids hung out in the pool all day. The event was a great success. I believe we were able to raise just under $4000 which is amazing!!! This money will go a long way towards helping out a family in need.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>I want to thank everyone that helped out and donated to help others and canât wait for next yearâs event!!!</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Thanks again,</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The Streeter Family</em>\r\n\r\nCheyenne and Angela, we can\'t thank YOU enough, and we can\'t wait for next year\'s event, either. The support of fundraisers like yours will help us support more families in crisis due to cancer.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to host an event, or know someone who would, please <a href=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/contact/\">contact us</a> today - we\'d love to discuss it with you.

It was an awesome summer party complete with a dunk tank(!), games, swimming, delicious food, music and family fun. Check out this great video highlighting the event:\n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEOAm_KAjSY[/embed]\n\n(Special thanks to Brian Dickman for another awesome video, and Missy Dickman for the great photos!)\n\nAfter the event, Cheyenne wrote the following letter to explain why he and Angela felt so strongly about holding a fundraiser for Tony Foundation:\n\n<em>I have known Tony for many years now and he and his family have become a big part of our lives. When we first heard of his first round of cancer we couldnât believe it, and to then hear that after he beat it he then came down with a second. Words canât express the way we felt!!!</em>\n\n<em>One thing we all know about Tony is he is probably the most positive person on the planet. Nothing is going to stop him from beating this terrible disease. Tony has managed to keep himself busy, whether it be continuing doing everything he did before to starting his foundation to help others.</em>\n\n<em>When Tony asked us to host a fundraiser at our house my answer was not yes, but \"heck\" yes! So, we immediately started planning. We wanted to have a relaxing event with all of our best friends and family. We made hamburgers, hot dogs, and had multiple sides brought in. The night before, the dunk tank was dropped off, which we had to try out (of course). Brett Curry donated multiple raffle items. James Delgado ran a 3-ball billiards tourney. Greg Rusnak ran a corn hole tourney. And of course, all the kids hung out in the pool all day. The event was a great success. I believe we were able to raise just under $4000 which is amazing!!! This money will go a long way towards helping out a family in need.</em>\n\n<em>I want to thank everyone that helped out and donated to help others and canât wait for next yearâs event!!!</em>\n\n<em>Thanks again,</em>\n\n<em>The Streeter Family</em>\n\nCheyenne and Angela, we can\'t thank YOU enough, and we can\'t wait for next year\'s event, either. The support of fundraisers like yours will help us support more families in crisis due to cancer.\n\nIf you would like to host an event, or know someone who would, please <a href=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/contact/\">contact us</a> today - we\'d love to discuss it with you. It might be something totally new, or an existing event that can help us in our mission to make a difference.\n\nSee some more great photos <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/tonyfoundation/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=2127210570896007\">here!</a>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-285\" src=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Streeter-pool-300x192.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"192\" />', 'Our Friends Make All the Difference', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '281-autosave-v1', '', '', '2018-08-15 01:34:07', '2018-08-15 01:34:07', '', 281, 'http://tonyfoundation.org/281-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The first-ever Drive Away Cancer Golf Tournament has its first-ever Gold Sponsor: <a href=\"https://www.rebath.com/location/austin/\">Re-Bath of Austin.</a> We are honored to have their support!\r\n\r\nItâs no surprise that such a community-oriented company like Re-Bath would step up to the tee box when it comes to helping families affected by cancer. âWhen they learned about our golf tournament, Re-Bath was very supportive of the cause,â said Tony Laudadio, founder of Tony Foundation. âThey heard our story, and how it came about, and they asked how they could help.â\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-293 alignright\" src=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/rebath2-300-for-blog-300x174.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" />As the Gold Sponsor, Re-Bath is helping to underwrite the Sept. 28 tournament with a $2,500 contribution. The inaugural event is already a huge success, with 128 golfers set to tee off (in teams of four) at iconic Lions Municipal Golf Course in Austin.\r\n\r\nLaudadio said that Re-Bath is a great fit for the fundraiser â and for Austin. âEveryone knows that if you hire Re-Bath, they are the company that will come in and do a great bathroom model at a great price,â Laudadio said. âIn fact, Iâve had a Re-Bath remodel, and so have many of my friends, and weâve all been very happy with the results. But did you also know how much they support this community?\r\n\r\nâTheyâve always been very community oriented, they give back in so many ways, and by helping support our mission, it just demonstrates how they put that commitment into action. Weâre really thrilled to have their support.â\r\n\r\n<strong>A veteran-owned-and-operated business</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Austin location is one of more than 120 Re-Bath locations in the U.S., and it was founded in 2013 by Josh and Debra Agrelius. There are currently 23 full-time employees on the Re-Bath of Austin team â each is fully licensed and insured, and Re-Bath is even a state-licensed as a plumbing company. They can help make your bathroom more stylish or more accessible for the aging or disabled, and provide a complete bathroom remodel.\r\n\r\n<strong>A special thanks to all of our sponsors</strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-294 alignright\" src=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tony-Lions-blog-300x192.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"192\" />The generosity of local businesses and individuals has helped make the first Drive Away Cancer tournament a success before a single ball has been struck. âWe are overwhelmed and humbled by the support weâve received, knowing that weâll be able to help more families thanks to contributions from all of our sponsors.\r\n\r\nWhile there are still sponsorships available, we

The first-ever Drive Away Cancer Golf Tournament has its first-ever Gold Sponsor: <a href=\"https://www.rebath.com/location/austin/\">Re-Bath of Austin.</a> We are honored to have their support!\n\nItâs no surprise that such a community-oriented company like Re-Bath would step up to the tee box when it comes to helping families affected by cancer. âWhen they learned about our golf tournament, Re-Bath was very supportive of the cause,â said Tony Laudadio, founder of Tony Foundation. âThey heard our story, and how it came about, and they asked how they could help.â\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-293 alignright\" src=\"http://tonyfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/rebath2-300-for-blog-300x174.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" />As the Gold Sponsor, Re-Bath is helping to underwrite the Sept. 28 tournament with a $2,500 contribution. The inaugural event is already a huge success, with 128 golfers set to tee off (in teams of four) at iconic Lions Municipal Golf Course in Austin.\n\nLaudadio said that Re-Bath is a great fit for the fundraiser â and for Austin. âEveryone knows that if you hire Re-Bath, they are the company that will come in and do a great bathroom model at a great price,â Laudadio said. âIn fact, Iâve had a Re-Bath remodel, and so have many of my friends, and weâve all been very happy with the results. But did you also know how much they support this community?\n\nâTheyâve always been very community oriented, they give back in so many ways, and by helping support our mission, it just demonstrates how they put that commitment into action. Weâre really thrilled to have their support.â\n\n<strong>A veteran-owned-and-operated business</strong>\n\nThe Austin location is one of more than 120 Re-Bath locations in the U.S., and it was founded in 2013 by Josh and Debra Agrelius. There are currently 23 full-time employees on the Re-Bath of Austin team â each is fully licensed and insured, and Re-Bath is even a state-licensed as a plumbing company. They can help make your bathroom more stylish or more accessible for the aging or disabled, and provide a complete bathroom remodel.\n\n<strong>A special thanks to all of our sponsors</strong>\n\n<img

businesses and individuals has helped make the first Drive Away Cancer tournament a success before a single ball has been struck. âWe are overwhelmed and humbled by the support weâve received, knowing that weâll be able to help more families thanks to contributions from all of our sponsors.\n\nWhile there are still sponsorships available, we would like to thank those who have signed up
